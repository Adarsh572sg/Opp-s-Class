## Introduction

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates the data. This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of OOP concepts using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh572sg/Opp-s-Class.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
cd Opp-s-Class
jupyter notebook
```

Open any of the notebooks to start learning and experimenting with OOP concepts.

## Notebooks

- **Introduction to OOP**: An overview of object-oriented programming and its key concepts.
- **Classes and Objects**: Examples and explanations of classes, objects, and their interactions.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrations of inheritance and how it allows for code reuse and extension.
- **Polymorphism**: Examples of polymorphism and how it enables methods to operate on objects of different classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Explanation of encapsulation and how it helps protect the internal state of objects.
- **Abstraction**: Examples of abstraction and how it simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
